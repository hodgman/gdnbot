Install luvit
https://luvit.io/install.html

use it to run gdn:
luvit gdn

But first, you need to get your hands on `secrets.lua` (the passwords) and `gdn_state` (the database)

if you try to use a part of luvit and your require statement doesn't work, you may have to download the files with lit 
e.g. lit install luvit/fs
