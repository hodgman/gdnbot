Install luvit
https://luvit.io/install.html

use it to run gdn:
luvit gdn

But first, you need to get your hands on `secrets.lua` (the passwords) and `gdn_state` (the database)

Docs are here
https://luvit.io/api/
But they're shit, so the nodejs docs may be better:
https://nodejs.org/api/

if you try to use a part of luvit and your require statement doesn't work, you may have to download the files with lit 
lit install luvit/fs
